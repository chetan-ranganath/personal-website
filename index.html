            <p>
              Welcome to my digital corner! I'm currently a backend developer
              who enjoys crafting clean, efficient systems with Spring Boot. I'm
              always experimenting with quirky side projects and exploring the
              world of CI/CD, containers, and DevOps. Full-stack is the next
              stop on my journey — and I'm well on my way.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm always building something weird, reading something nerdy, or
              debugging something that worked five minutes ago.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I started with Java, stayed for the chaos of Spring Boot, and now I'm
          branching into DevOps — because apparently sleep is optional. I thrive
          on problem-solving, clean architecture, and during downtime, you'll
          find me gaming, watching basketball, or wrenching away at my bike or
          car.
